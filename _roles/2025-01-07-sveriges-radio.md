## React migration

My team was midway through migrating sverigesradio.se to Next.js when I joined.
We were using the same Strangler Fig pattern that I employed for the
[React migration at Natural Cycles](/cv/natural-cycles/#headless-wordpress), but
at a higher level of complexity due to the heavy traffic, the dynamic nature of
the site, and the importance of its role in Swedish society.

A favourite recurring contribution of mine here has been to take point on the
final prep in the days before switching an endpoint over to the new system.
Getting a release day to go smoothly is a real kick when everything goes right.

## Accessibility

Nowhere else I've worked takes accessibility as seriously as SR, so
[my CPWA experience](/2023/01/14/my-cpwa-experience/) has been important here.
Everything we build gets checked over by a third-party auditor, and then we
actually _fix_ the issues they find, so being the kind of collaborator who can
identify and explain accessibility bugs during code review has been an impactful
way to avoid momentum being lost to large retrofitting projects.

I spent a bit of time out on loan to other teams, helping them prepare their
parts of the site to go live on the new React-based system, and received a lot
of very heartwarming feedback about how much they learned about accessibility
during that time.

## Ops

Grafana and Sentry have been like second homes during my time here. Monitoring
for new crashes after each release has been part of the heartbeat of the job,
and there's been a good healthy number of telemetry data mysteries to explore
and solve.

Due to SR's role in Sweden's civil defense and critical social infrastructure
the stakes here are relatively high when it comes to uptime and security, so
identifying and addressing these kinds of issues promptly has been key.
