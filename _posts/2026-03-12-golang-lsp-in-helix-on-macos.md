Since
[getting my Forgejo dev environment running](2026/03/10/running-a-forgejo-dev-environment/)
I've begun poking around the
[issue backlog](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/issues) and learning my way
around the code, looking for the stepping stones to becoming a contributor. One
important early milestone was to get the Golang LSP running in Helix.

You can always check if Helix's LSP integration for a given language is ready by
using `hx --health`.

```
$ hx --health go
Configured language servers:
  ✘ gopls: 'gopls' not found in $PATH
  ✘ golangci-lint-lsp: 'golangci-lint-langserver' not found in $PATH
Configured debug adapter:
  ✘ 'dlv' not found in $PATH
Configured formatter: None
Tree-sitter parser: ✓
Highlight queries: ✓
Textobject queries: ✓
Indent queries: ✓
```

Those ✘ symbols are bad news! Installing those missing tools looked like this.

```
go install golang.org/x/tools/gopls@latest
go install github.com/nametake/golangci-lint-langserver@latest
go install github.com/go-delve/delve/cmd/dlv@latest
brew install golangci-lint
```

That last `brew install` there is good to know about. You'll get ✓✓✓ from
`hx --health` without it, but linting won't actually work, and instead there's
an error about `exec: "golangci-lint": executable not found in $PATH`.

Then there was one last little trick necessary. Those things that `go install`
downloaded live in `~/go/bin`, which isn't in `$PATH`. I threw a Fish plugin at
the problem, like this.

```
fisher install halostatue/fish-go@v2
```

After that, I had ✓ across the board.

```
$ hx --health go
Configured language servers:
  ✓ gopls: /Users/henrycatalinismith/go/bin/gopls
  ✓ golangci-lint-lsp: /Users/henrycatalinismith/go/bin/golangci-lint-langserver
Configured debug adapter:
  ✓ /Users/henrycatalinismith/go/bin/dlv
Configured formatter: None
Tree-sitter parser: ✓
Highlight queries: ✓
Textobject queries: ✓
Indent queries: ✓
```

Here's Helix in action with the tooling integrated, successfully detecting a
linter error resulting from an unused variable.
