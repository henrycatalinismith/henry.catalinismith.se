After building last week’s Solar System renderer, I was excited to move on to
the fun stuff and see some planets moving around. I rushed on into implementing
motion, which on the face of it is pretty simple. If Earth is moving along at
30,000m/s, for example, then you can just add its velocity to its current
position once per second and get its new location.

The code for this is an easy read. I threw together a little Motion class. So if
Earth has a vector of 30000 horizontally and 0 vertically, then each tick of
this method counts as one second of motion in my imaginary 2D universe, and it
moves the earth along by 30km each time.

```
class Motion {
  affect (universe) {
  universe.planets.map((planet) => {
    planet.position.add(planet.vector);
  });
  }
}
```

This worked on my first try, which as usual, meant I’d barely broken the surface
of the problem. To give you a sense of perspective, here’s ten seconds of motion
in plain old 1:1 time. It’s not exactly riveting. Earth’s 12,000km diameter
makes 30km/s look slow. Honestly, I kind of thought it’d be a bit quicker, even
at 1:1 scale. Remember this next time somebody’s talking about how we’re
“hurtling through space on a giant rock”. It barely moves at all in this clip.

No way I’m waiting an entire real-life year to see my simulated Earth make its
way around the Sun once. What I needed was a way to speed up time.

Something I quickly realised was that this was more or less the same problem as
the viewport scaling, just dressed up a little differently. The symmetry carries
over into the solution, too, because just like in the graphical layer, I ended
up creating a scale property to represent the conversion rate. This time, it was
for converting between real life seconds and imaginary space seconds. So a scale
of 1 gives you one second per real second, and a scale of 60 gives you a minute
per real second, and so on.

The timing code is too involved (💤) to show a decent summarised version here.
The gist of it is that for each tick, it multiplies the real life tick interval
length by the scale factor, and passes that to any physics calculations so that
they can multiply their results by that. For motion, that just means multiplying
the planet’s vector by the number of seconds elapsed before adding it to the
planet’s position.

```
class Motion {
  affect (universe, seconds) {
  universe.planets.map((planet) => {
    planet.position.add(
    planet.vector.scale(seconds)
    );
  });
  }
}
```

Now here’s the Earth again, this time with scale pumped up to 600. That’s 10
imaginary space minutes for every real world second. If you’re good at maths you
might notice that this video is 18 seconds long, and the timer doesn’t make it
to 3 hours like it should at this scale. But then if you were paying that kind
of attention you’d have noticed that only 10 seconds pass in the 12 second video
earlier! Still got some minor issues to iron out there 😇

This is going great so far. It isn’t perfect, but I’m reasonably pleased with
it. Getting the foundational stuff like graphics and timing right makes it so
much more enjoyable to build the complicated stuff on top.
