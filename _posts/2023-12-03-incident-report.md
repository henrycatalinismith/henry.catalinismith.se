This weekend there was a minor incident where 666a over-alerted a little bit,
resulting in a total of less than 100 email alerts to be sent in error. No data
loss or privacy breaches occurred as part of this incident, just a few emails
getting sent that shouldn't have.

Here's the explanatory email I sent to the folks who got some unnecessary
emails.

> Hey folks
>
> Earlier today 666a went a bit haywire and started sending loads of email
> notifications about arbetsmiljöverket filings from April. It’s fixed now and
> you shouldn’t see any more.
>
> I take operating this service really seriously and wanted to get in touch and
> explain. I’ve been tweaking the diarium update algorithm this week to try to
> avoid missing documents if they’re filed late and then backdated to earlier in
> the week. While doing so I made a small coding mistake that turned on email
> notifications for all documents.
>
> Normally only a fraction of documents get email notifications sent about them.
> I’ve got 666a slowly backfilling its database with the entire 2023 dataset
> because I think I can operate the service best with at least one complete year
> of data history. Email notifications are switched off for those historical
> documents but my change this week accidentally turned them on.
>
> Rest assured it won’t happen again, and as you can tell I'm very biased
> towards overalerting rather than ever risk someone missing something, so I
> think that's at least not completely terrible.
>
> Henry
