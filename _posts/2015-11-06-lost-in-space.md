Simulating gravity has made all the other space-related code I’ve written so far
for this project seem easy. This has been one of those demoralising problems
that you think you’ve solved until you try a new test scenario and suddenly
you’re back at square one because it turns out it was never really working right
at all. For a good while I genuinely didn’t think I was going to be able to make
it work at all.

## The equation

On the face of it, gravity’s really simple. It’s a tiny little formula that
converts a body’s mass and your distance from it into your gravitational
acceleration.

## First attempts

At least, it would have been that simple if I’d done a better job of the initial
research. My first attempts were using a totally different and wrong equation
that I hacked together based on an incomplete understanding of various things
I’d hastily skim-read from Google.

I threw a bunch of code together, all excited to see some proper space stuff
happening. The first test run felt so climactic that I recorded it. Here it is.
Even if you really sucked at physics in school, I promise you’re gonna be able
to spot the problem. Check it out.

Yep, it’s backwards. The Earth takes one look at the Sun, turns around, and
heads off into deep space. Even worse, the Sun itself seems to be being affected
way more than it should by Earth’s comparatively tiny gravitational force.

## If at first you don't succeed

There were lots more failed attempts shortly after this. Each one was more
confusing than the last. I didn’t know what I was doing. I kept making little
tweaks to the calculations without really understanding why. No wonder none of
them worked.

This went on for a few days. Gradually I started to slow down and get a bit more
methodical. Lots of stepping through equations to try to get a feel for the
numbers. And yes, I use the word “Sol” instead of just “Sun” in one of the
diagrams, purely because it felt more sciencey to write 😎

After a few more days, the gravity calculation was sort of working. It was still
miles away from being anything close to correct, but good enough progress to
keep me interested.

## Bodge it and scarper

I thought I was close to nailing it. When I saw it get the Moon to orbit the
Earth, I was so happy I took another screen recording. This was around about the
same time I discovered that deleting the call to clearRect made it leave behind
a cool orbit trail.

Wow, I was so pleased with that. Thing is, I’d had to grossly inflate the mass
of the Earth to make it work like that, and I had no idea why. Everything was
sort of working, but full of these weird little hacky tweaks that I didn’t know
why they helped.

By now I was using the right gravity equation. But I had to subtract the result
from 0 to make it work. Again, no idea why. It was just something I did at one
point to see if it helped, and it did, so I left it in.

```
const acceleration = 0 - (
  (G * subject.mass) /
  (Math.pow(distance, 2))
)
```

## Me reaping: Well this fucking sucks. What the fuck.

So I definitely had a rude awakening coming. It came when I decided to test it
with four Moons orbiting the Earth. They were positioned equidistant around the
Earth and initialised with what should have been anti-clockwise orbits of equal
sizes. What should happen in this next video is basically the same as in the
last one except with four circles instead of one.

Backwards gravity was back, and yet again, I had no idea why. It was
demoralising as fuck.

The only thing to do was keep on going and try to get a little bit more serious
and careful with each step. The thing about building this is that the gravity
calculation is only a tiny part of it. Most of the work so far has gone into the
geometry code. You need to be able to calculate angles and distances between
points, add vectors together, and calculate vectors from an angle and a
magnitude. Lots of Math.atan2 and that sort of thing.

The gravity calculation was okay, so I knew the problem was elsewhere and
started digging around accordingly. There was something wrong with how I was
applying the gravity to the planets. I started to try to tighten up my
understanding of the basic geometry of this imaginary universe I’d built.

Once I understood the basics a little better, I did what I always do when I’m as
lost as this: I wrote tests. So many fucking tests… Just, basic things like
putting two points next to each other and checking that the distances and angles
are being calculated right. I wrote dozens of tests like that.

While I was writing a crapload of tests, I made a few teeny tiny little tweaks
along the way. None of it seemed major. Somehow, though, things started working
a bit better. I set the “four moons” test case back up, ready to be disappointed
and feel stupid.

Almost perfect! This is where I’m at right now, and it’s good enough to consider
moving on to whatever the next problem will be. It’s still a long way from
perfect, but I haven’t seen any “backwards gravity” and to be honest, that’ll
do.

Earth’s orbit around the Sun takes about 10 days longer than it should. And the
Moon’s orbit around the Earth takes about half the time it should. Just like
before, I haven’t got the slightest idea why. But this project doesn’t really
have any explicit goals beyond “build something that makes my computer do some
cool space stuff, and have fun doing it”. And it’s doing the cool space stuff
well enough to be fun now!
